# Federation

**Note**
It has been a while since this lab was created and used last.  However, Microsoft has an official template for deploying AD FS that I recommend: [Active Directory Federation in Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/deployment/how-to-connect-fed-azure-adfs#template-for-deploying-ad-fs-in-azure)
