# LABS

This project is a collection of labs that I use for testing and learning tools like MDI, MDE, ADFS, and others.  I'm sharing this so others can also use these labs to quickly establish learning environments. Information about these labs is now being documented on (my blog for the lab available here)[https://davidmcwee.com/labs/].
