# Defender for Endpoint Scurity Lab

This is a Azure Resource Manager deployment template that deploys Ubuntu, CentOS, and SUSE Linux instances. 

The primary intent of this lab is to support MDE on Linux deployment testing/learning, but it can really be used for any Linux learning purpose. More details about this lab can be found on [my blog](https://davidmcwee.com/labs/linux).
